# Honeybee-Classification-MiniProject
### ABSTRACT 

  This paper presents, a study on the Multi-classification of honey bees using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Honey bees play a vital role in pollination and are essential for ecosystem sustainability. A comprehensive dataset containing images of multiple honey bees was compiled, preprocessed  and utilized to train a CNN model. The CNN architecture demonstrated remarkable performance in distinguishing between multiple bee species.he CNN architecture demonstrated remarkable performance in distinguishing between multiple bee categories, thus facilitating the identification of a range of honey bees. The model's effectiveness was assessed using a variety of evaluation metrics and compared to conventional image. Detailed analysis of the results and the influence of the architectural parameters, such as the impact of data augmentation, provide insights into how to apply the approach to the target application.
